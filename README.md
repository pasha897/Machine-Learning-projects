This project predicts customer churn via Logistic Regression on historical data. After importing data into Pandas, it applies Label Encoding to categorical features, splits into X/y, trains (80 % train / 20 % test), and evaluates using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reportâ€”emphasizing recall.

This notebook demonstrates a customer churn prediction project using Logistic Regression. The goal is to identify whether a customer is likely to leave a service (churn) based on historical customer data. The workflow begins with importing the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, followed by essential preprocessing. Since the dataset contains categorical features such as gender, contract type, and payment method, Label Encoding is applied to convert them into numerical values that machine learning algorithms can understand.
Next, the data is divided into independent features (X) and the target variable (y, representing churn). The dataset is then split into training and testing sets, with 80% used for training and 20% reserved for evaluation. A Logistic Regression model is built using scikit-learn and trained on the training data. Logistic Regression is chosen for its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in binary classification problems like churn prediction.
After training, the model is tested on the unseen test data. Predictions are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report. These provide insights into how well the model distinguishes churners from non-churners. The results highlight performance trade-offs, particularly the importance of recall for detecting churned customers.
