This project predicts customer churn via Logistic Regression on historical data. After importing data into Pandas, it applies Label Encoding to categorical features, splits into X/y, trains (80 % train / 20 % test), and evaluates using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reportâ€”emphasizing recall.
